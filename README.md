### Server Configuration
To configure the server, you need to modify the `application.yml` file file by downloading it from [here](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example). Remember to update the address in the example configuration. Place the downloaded file in the working directory, usually located under the `/bin` directory in the extracted **OpenJDK**.(You have the flexibility to place the OpenJDK in your project directory or any desired location)
